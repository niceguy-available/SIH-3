# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Harden the Lunar image registration workspace (Moon Match Points). This session:
  (1) Add automatic coordinate-matched LROC reference retrieval with persistent cache reuse across sessions.
  (2) Complete the release-gate deliberate-failure test matrix and verify Emergent Object Storage.
  Reference DB: https://lroc.im-ldi.com/images/downloads/ (live). Philosophy: honest failure over a forced false match.

Matches local curated footprints (match_footprints helper), reuses persistent cache (references collection + object storage) when present (from_cache=true, no LROC request), else fetches from allowlisted LROC URL, stores to object storage, tags product_id, returns from_cache=false. Verified via curl: Tycho reuse (from_cache true), fresh fetch prefer_cache=false (from_cache false, new sha), north pole match, invalid coords 422. Needs independent verification incl. 404 (no match is impossible with global mosaics so 404 only via unknown; honest 503 on all-fail)."

      message: "BUG FIX to verify: user uploaded a source, my auto-fetch-on-upload selected the whole-Moon WAC mosaic, registration FAILED (honest: insufficient/ambiguous matches), and the run detail showed empty metrics/match_points arrays (queued/failed), confusing the user. Fix (frontend only; backend already correct): (1) ResultsPanel now renders a status-aware explanation panel data-testid='results-status-note' with results-status-title/results-status-body — for status failed => 'No valid transform found' + diagnostics + guidance to enter lat/long or upload a matching-scale reference; for queued/running => 'Registration in progress'; for cancelled => 'Run cancelled'. (2) Auto-fetch-on-upload toast now nudges to enter lat/long for a closer regional match. VERIFY: (a) Open a FAILED run from Run history (/runs -> open-run-{id}) and confirm results-status-note appears with the failure explanation and the metrics tiles show '—' (this is the reported scenario). (b) Backend GET /api/registration/runs/{id} for a failed run returns metrics=null, match_points=[], diagnostics non-empty, quality_gate.checks populated (all fail) — confirm this is correct honest behavior, not a data bug. (c) Auto-fetch: on the workspace, uploading a source with no reference selected auto-selects a reference (reference-catalog-select non-empty) and run becomes enabled. Do NOT delete the references collection or existing runs. Note there are existing completed runs (78cd45c9) and failed runs (61f22fcc-04af-40f2-af59-c41d1de35167) in history."
